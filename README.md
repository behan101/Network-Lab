# Network-Lab

## Objective

The goal of the Network Lab is to design and configure a network using Cisco Packet Tracer. This lab will demonstrate the essential networking devices such as routers, switches, computers, configure IP addressing, and establish network connectivity.

### Skills Learned

- Network Device Configuration: Set up and configure basic networking devices such as routers, switches, and PCs.
- IP Addressing: Assign and configure static IP addresses for network devices to ensure proper communication.
- Router Configuration: Set up routing on a router to enable connectivity between different network segments.
- Switch Configuration: Configure basic switch settings to facilitate communication within a local area network (LAN).
- Basic Network Troubleshooting: Identify and resolve common connectivity issues using tools like Ping and Traceroute.
- Subnetting Basics: Apply subnetting concepts to divide a network into smaller, manageable subnets.
- Connectivity Testing: Use basic network testing commands to verify proper network functionality.
- Hands-on Network Design: Gain experience in designing a small-scale network layout using Packet Tracer.

### Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer: A network simulation software used to design and simulate network topologies and configurations.
- Router: A device used to route data between different networks, configured with basic routing protocols and interfaces.
- Switch: A device that facilitates communication within a local area network (LAN) by connecting multiple devices.
- PC (Personal Computer): An end device used to simulate user devices on the network, with the ability to configure IP addresses and test connectivity.
- Console Cable: A cable used for device management, typically connecting a PC to network devices like routers and switches for configuration.
- Ethernet Cable (Copper or Fiber): Used for physical connections between devices such as routers, switches, and computers in the network.
- Ping Command: A network diagnostic tool used to test connectivity between devices by sending ICMP echo requests.
- Traceroute Command: A tool used to track the path data takes across a network, helping to identify network delays or failures.

Establishing a connection with a PC and Laptop on the network. After physically connecting the PC to the router with an ethernet cable, I enabled DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) within the PC configurations to establish a connection. I then checked the connection using ipconfig within command prompt to identify the IPv4 Address, subnet mask, and default gateway. I also performed the same tasks for the laptop after installing the physical wireless adapter for wireless internet access.
